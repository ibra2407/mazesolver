# Maze Solver using Genetic Algorithm

![Maze Solver Demo](demo.gif)

This project utilizes the power of genetic algorithms to find the optimal path through a maze. The implementation is done in Python using the PyAmaze library.

## Introduction

The Maze Solver uses a (self-made) genetic algorithm to evolve a population of individuals (potential solutions) until an optimal or near-optimal solution is found. The PyAmaze library is employed for generating and visualizing mazes, making it a versatile and powerful tool for solving maze-related problems.
Each **"Worm"** is a solution and is represented by red paths. When the maze is solved, the final Worm is represented as a blue path.
