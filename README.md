## Introduction

The Maze Solver uses a (self-made) genetic algorithm to evolve a population of individuals (potential solutions) until an optimal or near-optimal solution is found. The PyAmaze library is employed for generating and visualizing mazes, making it a versatile and powerful tool for solving maze-related problems.
Each **"Worm"** is a solution and is represented by red paths. When the maze is solved, the final Worm is represented as a blue path.

## Demo

The gif below demonstrates how the maze solver works. Each **"Worm"** is a solution and is represented by red paths. When the maze is solved, the final Worm is represented as a blue path.
